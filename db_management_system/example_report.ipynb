    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient data storage and retrieval are fundamental challenges in computer science, particularly crucial for database systems managing large datasets. Standard methods like linear scanning through unsorted lists become prohibitively slow as data volume grows. This project addresses this challenge by implementing a lightweight Database Management System (DBMS) in Python that utilizes a **B+ Tree** index for efficient data management.\n",
    "\n",
    "The B+ Tree is a self-balancing tree structure optimized for scenarios requiring efficient disk-based or large in-memory data access. Its key advantages over simpler structures (like the brute-force list approach) include:\n",
    "*   **Logarithmic Time Complexity:** Search, insertion, and deletion operations typically perform in O(log N) time, where N is the number of records, significantly faster than the O(N) time of linear scans.\n",
    "*   **Efficient Range Queries:** The linked-list structure connecting leaf nodes allows for rapid retrieval of records within a specified key range.\n",
    "*   **High Fanout:** Internal nodes can store many keys, leading to a wide and shallow tree, minimizing the number of node accesses required to locate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report details the implementation of the B+ Tree based DBMS, analyzes its performance against a brute-force baseline, and demonstrates its core functionalities, including persistence and visualization."

    "## 2. Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is built around several key Python classes organized within the `database` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`BPlusTreeNode`:** Represents nodes within the B+ Tree. A flag (`is_leaf`) distinguishes between internal nodes and leaf nodes.\n",
    "    *   **Internal Nodes:** Store keys that guide searches and pointers (`children`) to child nodes.\n",
    "    *   **Leaf Nodes:** Store sorted keys and their associated values (data records). They also contain pointers (`next_leaf`) to their right sibling, forming a linked list for efficient range scans.\n",
    "*   **`BPlusTree`:** Manages the overall tree structure, including the root node and the tree's order (maximum number of children/keys per node).\n",
    "    *   **Insertion:** Keys are inserted into the appropriate leaf node. If a node becomes full (exceeds `order - 1` keys), it splits. For leaf splits, the middle key is *copied* up to the parent. For internal node splits, the middle key is *pushed* up to the parent. Root splits increase the tree's height.\n",
    "    *   **Deletion:** Keys are removed from the leaf node. If a node becomes underflow (less than the minimum required keys, typically around `order/2`), it attempts to *borrow* a key from a sibling. If borrowing is not possible, the node is *merged* with a sibling. Merging might require removing a key from the parent and can propagate upwards, potentially decreasing the tree's height if the root becomes empty.\n",
    "    *   **Search:** Traverses from the root down, using keys in internal nodes to guide the path to the correct leaf node, where the key is then searched for.\n",
    "    *   **Range Query:** Performs a search for the `start_key` to find the initial leaf node. Then, it traverses the leaf nodes using the `next_leaf` pointers, collecting all key-value pairs until the `end_key` is exceeded.\n",
    "    *   **Visualization:** Includes a `visualize_tree` method using the `graphviz` library to generate a graphical representation of the tree structure, showing nodes, keys, parent-child links, and leaf-to-leaf links.\n",
    "*   **`Table`:** Represents a database table. Internally, it uses a `BPlusTree` instance to store and index its records. It provides methods like `insert`, `select`, `delete`, `update`, and `range_query`, which delegate the core logic to the underlying B+ Tree.\n",
    "*   **`Database`:** Manages a collection of `Table` objects (stored in a dictionary keyed by table name). It provides methods for creating (`create_table`), deleting (`delete_table`), and retrieving (`get_table`) tables.\n",
    "*   **Persistence:** Implemented within the `Database` class using Python's `pickle` module. The `save_database` method serializes the dictionary of `Table` objects (which includes their B+ Tree structures) to a file. The `_load_database` method deserializes this data when the `Database` object is initialized, allowing the database state to persist across program executions. Parent pointers within the tree (which are transient) are restored after loading using the `_restore_parents` helper method.\n",
    "*   **`BruteForceDB`:** A simple baseline implementation using a Python list to store key-value pairs. Operations like search, delete, and range query involve linear scans of this list."

    "## 5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project successfully implemented a lightweight DBMS featuring a B+ Tree index. The performance analysis clearly demonstrates the significant advantages of using a B+ Tree over a brute-force approach for managing and querying data, especially as the dataset size increases. Operations like search, deletion, and particularly range queries exhibit substantially better time complexity with the B+ Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges:**\n",
    "*   Implementing the deletion logic, including borrowing and merging strategies while maintaining tree properties, was complex and required careful handling of edge cases (e.g., root underflow, sibling interactions).\n",
    "*   Ensuring correct handling of parent pointers and leaf node links during splits and merges was critical.\n",
    "*   Accurately measuring memory usage for complex nested structures like a tree can be challenging in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Findings:**\n",
    "*   The B+ Tree consistently outperformed the brute-force method in search, deletion, and range queries, aligning with theoretical expectations (O(log N) vs O(N)).\n",
    "*   Insertion performance was also generally good, although the overhead of splits means it might not always be faster than simple list append for very small datasets, the logarithmic growth ensures scalability.\n",
    "*   The visualization component proved valuable for understanding and debugging the tree's dynamic behavior.\n",
    "*   Basic persistence using `pickle` was effective for saving and loading the database state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future Improvements:**\n",
    "*   Implement more robust persistence (e.g., custom serialization, logging) instead of relying solely on `pickle`.\n",
    "*   Add support for secondary indexes on non-key attributes.\n",
    "*   Implement basic transaction management (atomicity).\n",
    "*   Explore concurrency control mechanisms for multi-user access.\n",
    "*   Optimize node search (e.g., binary search within nodes instead of linear).\n",
    "*   Add support for more complex query types (e.g., joins - although this is significantly more complex)."
